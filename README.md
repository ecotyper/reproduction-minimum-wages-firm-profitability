# reproduction-minimum-wages-firm-profitability

Datasets as well as R code and Stata do-file for replication of the study by Draca et al. 2011:  Minimum Wages and Firm Profitability.

This respository includes following files:

1. The original Stata code provided by the authors in the folder: „Provided Stata Code“

2.  The annotated code of the reproduction in R: „Reproduction R Code“
	- Since small parts of the study could not be reproduced in R these were reproduced in Stata
	- To run the code the data files have to be imported correctly. To do that, change the file paths of the importing commands in lines 37, 39 and 658 to the file path of the datasets in the „Data“ folder.

3. The annotated code of the reproduction in Stata: „Reproduction Stata Code“
	- To run the code the working directory has to be changed to the path of the „Data“ folder in this repository.

4. All data that was used for the reproduction as .dta files in the folder: „Data“

5. Reproduced Tables 1 and 2 as well as Figures 1 and 2 of the paper in the folder: „Reproduced Tables and Figures“
